**Effective Date: April 06, 2025**

Welcome to **Fashion Tools, Converters, and Calculators** ("Fashion Tools," "we," "us," or "our"), a mobile application developed to assist users in determining accurate sizing for fashion accessories and clothing items, including gloves, bracelets, shoes, rings, dresses, watches, and hats, as well as additional features like style generation, health calculators, packing list guides, color matching guides, and handbag selection tools. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our app.

By using Fashion Tools, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the app.

## 1. Information We Collect

We may collect the following types of information when you use Fashion Tools:

### a. Personal Information

- **Measurements**: When you use our calculators (e.g., Glove Size Calculator, Bracelet Size Calculator, etc.), you may input personal measurements such as palm width, wrist size, foot length, finger circumference, or head circumference. These measurements are processed locally on your device to provide sizing recommendations.
- **Language Preferences**: Starting with Version 1.0.1, we collect your selected language settings to personalize your experience (e.g., English, Greek, or other supported languages added in Version 1.0.6).
- **Theme Preferences**: We store your choice of "Light" or "Dark" mode (introduced in Version 1.0.1 and fixed in Version 1.0.2) to enhance your user experience.

### b. Non-Personal Information

- **Usage Data**: We may collect anonymized data about how you interact with the app, such as which tools you use (e.g., Style Generator added in Version 1.0.3, Health Calculator added in Version 1.0.5), frequency of use, and navigation patterns. This helps us improve the app’s functionality.
- **Device Information**: We may collect technical details such as your device type, operating system, and app version to ensure compatibility and troubleshoot issues.

### c. No Account Required

Fashion Tools does not require you to create an account or provide identifiable personal information (e.g., name, email, or address) to use the app. All core features are accessible without registration.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

- **To Provide Services**: Your measurements are processed to calculate and display accurate sizing recommendations for gloves, bracelets, shoes, rings, dresses, watches, hats, and other tools.
- **To Personalize Your Experience**: Language settings (Version 1.0.6) and theme preferences (Version 1.0.1) are used to tailor the app to your preferences.
- **To Improve the App**: Usage data helps us identify popular features, fix bugs (e.g., theme bug fixed in Version 1.0.2), and develop new tools (e.g., handbag selection tool in Version 1.0.5).
- **To Support Maintenance**: Starting with Version 1.0.7, each tool has its own locales, making it easier for us to update and maintain the app efficiently.

---

## 3. How We Store Your Information

- **Local Storage**: Measurements you input into the calculators (e.g., palm width, wrist size) are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers unless explicitly saved by you (e.g., in a future "Measurement History" feature, if implemented).
- **No Cloud Sync**: As of Version 1.0.7, Fashion Tools does not sync your data to the cloud or across devices unless explicitly stated in future updates.
- **Retention**: We retain usage data and preferences only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law.

---

## 4. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share information only in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers**: We may work with third-party providers (e.g., analytics services) to process anonymized usage data. These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and are not permitted to use your data for other purposes.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or government request.
- **App Updates**: Translation data (Version 1.0.6) and tool-specific locales (Version 1.0.7) may be processed by third-party language services to support multilingual functionality, but no personal data is shared in this process.

---

## 5. Security of Your Information

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no method of data storage is 100% secure. Since most data (e.g., measurements) is stored locally on your device, your device’s security settings play a key role in protecting your information.

---

## 6. Third-Party Links and Services

Fashion Tools does not currently include external links or integrations (e.g., to brand size charts). If such features are added in the future, we will update this policy to reflect how third-party interactions affect your privacy.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

Fashion Tools is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that such information has been collected, we will take steps to delete it promptly.

---

## 8. Your Choices

- **Measurements**: You can choose not to input measurements or delete them from your device at any time.
- **Preferences**: You can change your language and theme settings within the app at any time.
- **Uninstall**: If you no longer wish to use Fashion Tools, uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app’s features (e.g., new tools added in Version 1.0.5) or legal requirements. The updated policy will be posted within the app, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
